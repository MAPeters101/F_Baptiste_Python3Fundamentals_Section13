'''
Question 2
Write a function that returns a string based on two input arguments:

a character or string to be repeated
the number of times the string should be repeated
The function should be such that the number of repetitions defaults to 10 if
it is not passed by the caller, and the default character to be repeated
should be a negative sign (-).

Call your function separator.

Use a keyword-only argument for the string argument.
